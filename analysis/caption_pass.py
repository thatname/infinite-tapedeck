"""Caption the corpus with Music Flamingo (8-bit): one rich prose description
per track — genre, mood arc, instrumentation, production character, vocal
character. Output feeds the Gemma rewrite into Music3's caption schema and
the essence-card enrichment.

GPU coordination: raises the tank daemon's PAUSE flag for the whole pass and
waits for any in-flight generation to drain before loading the model, so the
card is never contested. Resume-safe (path+hash keys), ~10-20s per track.

Usage: venv/bin/python analysis/caption_pass.py [--one] (self-test: first
uncaptioned track only, prints the result)
