"""The tank: keeps a buffer of generated-and-approved radio tracks topped up.

Generation runs slower than realtime (~0.6x at 30 steps), so the radio's
continuity lives here, not in the player: whenever the GPU is otherwise idle,
sample a vein from the essence cards, have Poe's Gemma write a fresh caption
(and lyrics, for the vocal vein), generate on the Music3 server, score the
result against the vein's corpus centroid with CLAP, and bank what passes.

Politeness, in priority order:
  1. Dean interactive (H3 queue busy, or a game holding VRAM) -> hold.
  2. A PAUSE file in this directory -> hold (manual override).
  3. Otherwise the card is ours.

H3 preemption can kill a run mid-generation (by design); that surfaces as a
non-success history status and costs one backoff, nothing more.

# Measured 2026-08-19: with a static prompt the lyricist mode-collapsed —
# "vending machine" appeared in 25 of 33 sung takes ever written, and the
# prompt's own example imagery (payphone, static, mixtape, fluorescent,
# parking) in 13 of the last 15. Examples in the prompt become attractors
# at temperature 1.0, so the prompt now carries NO example list. Instead
# each song ROLLS its anchors here (LLMs randomize poorly — the same
# reasoning as sample_caption), a persisted window rests recent rolls, and
# a ban list measured from the last takes' actual lyrics suppresses
# whatever the model is currently overusing, prompt-driven or spontaneous.
